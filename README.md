# migaku
Named after the Japanese word "migaku" (磨く), meaning "to grind" or "to polish," reflecting the process of refining and perfecting through persistent effort. This name was chosen to embody the relentless optimization and care put into crafting my projects. Migaku operates as a central hub for running my projects
